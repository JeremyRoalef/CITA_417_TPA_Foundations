<h1>INTRODUCTION</h1>
This lab aims to explore the effects of taking the optimization strategies from lab 5 and apply them at scale. The aim is to get a measurable performance increase to demonstrate that the optimization strategies work properly. To recap, the optimization strategies implement include level of detail and lighting quality settings.

<h1>SETUP</h1>
The lab started from the same levels in lab 5. Additionally, this lab introduces new objects with expensive and cheap counterparts. These new objects include:
<ul>Tables</ul>
<ul>Plates</ul>
<ul>Pillars</ul>
<ul>Maces</ul>
These assets will be used to create a larger scene with some detail.
These settings will apply high-quality shadows and lighting to the world.

<h1>RESULTS</h1>
Here is a simple table illustrating the performance difference between the optimized world and unoptimized world:
